                    <img id="claypic" alt="Fimo clay of various colours" src="Images/Fimo.jpg">

                    <p id="pclay1">This type of clay was a hit during my childhood, because it 
                        could be hardened in a normal oven and it had many different
                        colours.
                    </p>

                    <p id="pclay2">Luckily I do not have any examples of the jewellery I made, 
                        because it was surely hideous.</p>

                <h3 id="writeheading"><b>Writing</b></h3>
                    <img id="writingpic" alt="Little girl writing" src="Images/Writing.jpg">

                    <p id="pwrite1">Writing fiction - mostly about children having adventures. 
                        Features included an unlikely number of twins, complete absence of school and
                        unnecessarily long descriptions of everyone's outfits.
                    </p>

                    <p id="pwrite2">My dad was a book editor at that stage and I was convinced I was
                        going to write his next hit. The poor man dutifully read all 
                        the nonsense I wrote, never discouraging me. The hit, obviously,
                        was not forthcoming.

                <h3 id="profheading"><b><em>Little Professor</em></b></h3>
                    <img id="profpic" alt="Little Professor electronic game" src="Images/LittleProfessor.jpg">

                    <p id="pprof1">The <em>Little Professor</em> was an electronic game where 
                        you did increasingly difficult mental arithmetic against time.</p>

                    <p id="pprof2">Thinking back now, I can not imagine a little kid being 
                        interested in this toy. I, however, spent so many hours with it
                        that teachers had to give me other activities to do in class,
                        while the other kids did maths.</p>

                <h3 id="movheading"><b><em>Moviemaker</em> boardgame</b></h3>
                    <img id="moviepic" alt="Moviemaker board game" src="Images/Movie.jpg">

                    <p id="pmov1"><em>Moviemaker</em> was a boardgame where you 'made' movies by 
                    combining playing cards for actors, directors, etc.</p>

                    <p id="pmov2">I can not remember how the game worked, just that you got fewer 
                        points when you combined cards from different genres in the 
                        same movie. I also recall that dramas were worth the most 
                        points and horror films the least - typical.
